1. Creating a maze by
	- drawing and erasing walls by clicking on the grid
	- placing walls randomly according to desired wall density
	- generating a circular maze
	- generating carved out maze
2. Finding the shortest path through the maze using one of two algorithms and visualizing the search process with desired speed of animation
	- A\* Pathfinding Algorithm
	- Breadth-First Pathfinding Algorithm
3. Reset the grid if necessary
